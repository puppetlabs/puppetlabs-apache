Puppetlabs module for Apache
============================

Apache is widely-used web server and this module will allow to configure
various modules and setup virtual hosts with minimal effort.

Basic usage
-----------

To install Apache

    class {'apache':  }

To install the Apache PHP module

    class {'apache::php': }

Configure a virtual host
------------------------

You can easily configure many parameters of a virtual host. A minimal
example is:

    apache::vhost { 'www.example.com':
        priority        => '10',
        vhost_name      => '192.0.2.1',
        port            => '80',
    }

A slightly more complicated example, which moves the docroot and
logfile to an alternate location, might be:

    apache::vhost { 'www.example.com':
        priority        => '10',
        vhost_name      => '192.0.2.1',
        port            => '80',
        docroot         => '/home/www.example.com/docroot/',
        logroot         => '/srv/www.example.com/logroot/',
        serveradmin     => 'webmaster@example.com',
        serveraliases   => ['example.com',],
    }

Configure an IPv4 and IPv6 host
-------------------------------

Typically you will want to serve the same content to IPv4 and IPv6
users. And you are likely to want to have the logfile contain entries
from both virtual hosts.


    apache::vhost { 'www.example.com':
        priority        => '10',
        vhost_name      => '192.0.2.1',
        port            => '80',
    }

    apache::vhost { 'www.example.com-IPv6':
        servername      => 'www.example.com',
        priority        => '10',
        vhost_name      => '2001:db8::2:1',
        port            => '80',
        ensure_dirs     => false,
    }


By default, the variable `servername` is used to construct the path to
logfiles. In the first case, with no explicit configuration, the
`servername` is set to the name of the resource (i.e. www.example.com).

In the second case, we specifiy it explicitly. We also disable ensuring
that the `docroot` and `logroot` exist, since they will be handled by
the first virtual host definition.


Notes
-----

 * The name of the resource should not contain a space, as it may be
   used in various file paths.
