Puppetlabs module for Apache
============================

Apache is widely-used web server and this module will allow to configure
various modules and setup virtual hosts with minimal effort.

Basic usage
-----------

To install Apache

    class {'apache':  }

To install the Apache PHP module

    class {'apache::mod::php': }

Configure a virtual host
------------------------

You can easily configure many parameters of a virtual host. A minimal
example is:

    apache::vhost { 'www.example.com':
        priority        => '10',
        vhost_name      => '192.0.2.1',
        port            => '80',
    }

A slightly more complicated example, which moves the docroot and
logfile to an alternate location, might be:

    apache::vhost { 'www.example.com':
        priority        => '10',
        vhost_name      => '192.0.2.1',
        port            => '80',
        docroot         => '/home/www.example.com/docroot/',
        logroot         => '/srv/www.example.com/logroot/',
        serveradmin     => 'webmaster@example.com',
        serveraliases   => ['example.com',],
    }

Notes
-----

Since Puppet cannot ensure that all parent directories exist you need to
manage these yourself. In the more advanced example above, you need to ensure 
that `/home/www.example.com` and `/srv/www.example.com` directories exist.
