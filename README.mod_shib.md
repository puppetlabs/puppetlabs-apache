# Shibboleth module for Apache

The module `apache::mod::shib` configures the Apache Shibboleth Service Provider (SP) module in a manner consistent and compatible with the usage of the Puppetlabs Apache Module. Once this module is installed and configured it should just be a matter of specifying `authType shibboleth` in an Apache Virtual Host declaration.

## Shibboleth

Shibboleth is among the world's most widely deployed federated identity solutions, connecting users to applications both within and between organizations. Every software component of the Shibboleth system is free and open source.

Shibboleth is an open-source project that provides Single Sign-On capabilities and allows sites to make informed authorization decisions for individual access of protected online resources in a privacy-preserving manner.

# Example Usage

The following is an example installation:

```
# Set up Apache
class{'apache':	}
class{'apache::mod::shib': }

# Set up the Shibboleth Single Sign On (sso) module
apache::mod::shib::sso{'Federation_Directory':
	discoveryURL	=> 'https://example.federation.org/ds/DS',
}

apache::mod::shib::metadata{'Federation_metadata':
	provider_uri	=> 'https://example.federation.org/metadata/fed-metadata-signed.xml',
	cert_uri			=> 'http://example.federation.org/metadata/fed-metadata-cert.pem',
}

apache::mod::shib::attribute_map{'Federation_attribute_map':
	attribute_map_uri	=> 'https://example.federation.org/download/attribute-map.xml',
}

include apache::mod::shib::backend_cert
```
# Example Usage Breakdown

The following sections describe the sequence given in the Example Usage

## Apache and Shibboleth

```
# Set up Apache
class{'apache':	}
class{'apache::mod::shib': }
```

Setting up the `apache` class from the PuppetLabs Apache Module is a requirement, no extra configuration is required. It is recommended that the `serveradmin` parameter is set.

This is followed by installeing the Shibboleth module (`mod_shib`) for Apache. This provides the absolute minimum installation which could then be configured manually if desired.

## Configure Single Sign On with a Discovery Service

```
# Set up the Shibboleth Single Sign On (SSO) module
apache::mod::shib::sso{'Federation_Directory':
	discoveryURL	=> 'https://example.federation.org/ds/DS',
}
```

This snippet sets up a Single Sign On (SSO) service that uses a Directory Service to handle multiple federated Identity Providers (IDp). 

*Note:* The URL is an example only, the Federation should provide the correct URL to use for its directory service.

*Note:* Alternativly if only a sinlge IDp is to be used, use the `idpURL` parameter instead. The `idpURL` and `discoveryURL` parameters are mutually exclusive, the SSO can only use one or the other.

## Federation Metadata and Certificate

```
apache::mod::shib::metadata{'Federation_metadata':
	provider_uri	=> 'https://example.federation.org/metadata/fed-metadata-signed.xml',
	cert_uri			=> 'http://example.federation.org/metadata/fed-metadata-cert.pem',
}
```

Currently `apache::mod::shib::metadata` only supports a single metadata provider, but it is possible to configure Shibboleth to use multiple metadata in a co-federated environment, hence this has been devined as a resource to permit multiple declarations. This requires two URIs, one to obtain the Federation metadata XML file, and another to obtain the Federation metadata signing certificate.

# Updating the Attribute map

```
apache::mod::shib::attribute_map{'Federation_attribute_map':
	attribute_map_uri	=> 'https://example.federation.org/download/attribute-map.xml',
}
```

This is optional, and will allow `mod_shib` to use a customised attribute map downloaded from the provided URI. By default this is updated every 21 days. The parameter `max_age` can be used to set the number of days between updates.

# Create the Back-end x509 Certificate

```
include apache::mod::shib::backend_cert
```

This creates a self signed back-end x509 certificate and key with which this Service Provider can be registered with a Federation. This method currentl just runs the `shib-keygen` command with the values supplied in the `apache::mod::shib` configuration. It should be modified so that it can also install an specified certifcate and key from a Puppet fileserver, or using a suitable x509 certificate management Puppet Module.

# Attribution

The `apache::mod::shib` Puppet module was created Aaron Hicks (hicksa@landcareresearch.co.nz) for work on the NeSI Project and the Tuakiri New Zealand Access Federation as a fork from the PuppetLabs Apache module on GitHub.
